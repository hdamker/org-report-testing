- ‚úÖ Test token manually:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
    https://api.github.com/orgs/camaraproject/repos
  ```

**Token Approval Process**:
- Token requests with `camaraproject` as resource owner require admin approval
- Check token status in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Fine-grained tokens
- Contact CAMARA admin team if approval is delayed
- Ensure you requested all required permissions when creating the token

#### Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Workflows run longer than expected or timeout

**Repository Overview Solutions**:
- ‚úÖ Disable "Detailed activity analysis" for faster runs
- ‚úÖ Disable "Template compliance checks" for basic reports
- ‚úÖ Run during off-peak hours to avoid GitHub API congestion

**API Releases Solutions**:
- ‚úÖ Monitor workflow logs for API rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Consider running with fewer filter options initially
- ‚úÖ Check for repositories causing access errors

#### Missing Data in Reports
**Symptoms**: Expected repositories not appearing in reports

**Repository Overview**:
- ‚úÖ Check if repositories are archived (excluded by default)
- ‚úÖ Verify repository topics are set correctly
- ‚úÖ Review processing errors section in report

**API Releases**:
- ‚úÖ Ensure repositories have `sandbox-api-repository` or `incubating-api-repository` topics
- ‚úÖ Check if repositories are archived (automatically excluded)
- ‚úÖ Verify repository accessibility with your token

#### Template Compliance Issues
**Symptoms**: Unexpected compliance violations or missing checks

**Solutions**:
- ‚úÖ Verify README.md exists in repository root
- ‚úÖ Check that line 8 of README contains exact badge HTML

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How often should I run these workflows?**
A: Repository Overview weekly (automated), API Releases monthly or as needed for release tracking.

**Q: Can I run these workflows from any repository?**
A: Yes, as long as you have the proper FGPAT configured for cross-organization access to `camaraproject`.

**Q: What's the difference between the two workflows?**
A: Repository Overview focuses on general health and template compliance; API Releases focuses on release tracking and version analysis.

**Q: Which workflow should I run first?**
A: Start with Repository Overview as it provides the foundation understanding of all repositories, then use API Releases for specific release tracking needs.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do I need a Fine-grained Personal Access Token?**
A: The default GITHUB_TOKEN only works within the same repository/organization. You need elevated permissions to access the CAMARA organization from your personal repository.

**Q: Do I need admin rights in CAMARA to create the token?**
A: No, you create the token request with `camaraproject` as the resource owner, and the CAMARA admin team will review and approve it.

**Q: How long does token approval take?**
A: This depends on the CAMARA admin team's review process. Contact them directly if you need expedited approval.

**Q: Why can't I use my personal account as the resource owner?**
A: Fine-grained PATs with personal account as resource owner cannot set Organization Permissions for other organizations like `camaraproject`.

**Q: Can I schedule the API Releases workflow?**
A: Yes, you can add a schedule section to the workflow file if you want automated API release tracking.

### Repository Overview Questions

**Q: What does "Template used ‚úÖ" mean?**
A: This indicates that an API repository passes all 6 template compliance checks, including proper README format, badges, descriptions, and website links.

**Q: When should I enable template compliance checks?**
A: Enable when you need to audit API repositories for CAMARA template adherence. Disable for faster reports focused on activity and statistics.

**Q: Why is detailed activity analysis slower?**
A: It analyzes actual commits, issues, and PRs instead of just using GitHub's repository updated_at timestamp, requiring additional API calls.

**Q: What's the difference between simple and detailed activity analysis?**
A: Simple uses GitHub's updated_at field; detailed analyzes actual commits, issues, and PRs for more accurate last activity dates.

### API Releases Questions

**Q: Why does the API Releases report show limited information?**
A: The current version provides basic release tracking. Full functionality including meta-release analysis and API version tracking is planned for future implementation.

**Q: What does "Repositories Without Releases" mean?**
A: These are API repositories that have the proper topics but haven't published any releases yet.

**Q: When will the full API Releases functionality be available?**
A: The workflow is designed for easy expansion. Full functionality can be implemented based on specific requirements and priorities.

**Q: Can I modify the API Releases workflow to add more features?**
A: Yes, the workflow is structured to allow easy extension. Contact the workflow maintainer for guidance on specific enhancements.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The workflow runs but produces empty reports - why?**
A: Usually a permissions issue. Verify your FGPAT has access to the CAMARA organization and all required repository permissions.

**Q: Some repositories are missing from the reports - why?**
A: Check if they have the required topics and aren't archived. Repository Overview includes all repos; API Releases only includes those with API topics.

**Q: What if I see processing errors in the reports?**
A: Processing errors are normal for some repositories due to API rate limits or access restrictions. The workflows continue processing and report which repositories had issues.

**Q: Template compliance shows violations I disagree with - what should I do?**
A: Review the specific violation details in the report. The checks are based on CAMARA template standards - contact the template maintainers if standards need updating.
